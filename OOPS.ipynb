        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions or logic. An object represents a real-world entity and combines data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines what data an object will have and what actions it can perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " -  In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a real-world entity and an instance of a class. It represents something that has data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), abstraction and encapsulation are related concepts, but they solve different problems. Here’s a clear and simple comparison\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        " -  In Python, dunder methods are special methods with names that start and end with double underscores (__), short for “double underscore”.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        " -  Inheritance in OOP is a core principle where a new class (subclass/child) derives properties (data/fields) and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass/parent), promoting code reuse and creating an \"is-a\" relationship\n",
        "\n",
        "8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        " -  Encapsulation in Python is an OOP concept that bundles data (variables) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (a class) and restricts direct access to some of the object’s components.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        " -  In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize a newly created object's attributes and set its initial state. This method is automatically called every time an object is instantiated from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        " -  In Python, class methods and static methods are methods that are bound to the class rather than an instance of the class. The key difference lies in what they can access and their primary use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        " -  Method overloading is an OOP concept where multiple methods have the same name but different parameters (number or type), and the correct method is called based on the arguments passed.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        " -  Method overriding is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept where a child (subclass) provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent (superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " -  A property decorator in Python (@property) is used to define a method that can be accessed like an attribute, while still allowing controlled access, validation, and encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism is one of the four core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).Polymorphism allows different objects to respond differently to the same method call, which makes software more flexible, scalable, and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        " -  An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to serve as a blueprint for other classes. It defines abstract methods—methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        " -  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) advantages include better code organization (modularity, encapsulation), reusability via inheritance, flexibility through polymorphism, easier maintenance and debugging, improved security, and scalability, all by modeling real-world entities as self-contained \"objects\". This leads to less redundant code, faster development, and more robust, manageable software, especially for large systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        " -  Class Variable\n",
        "    -  Defined inside the class, outside any method\n",
        "    -  Only one copy exists, shared by all instances\n",
        "    -  Changing it affects all objects (unless overridden\n",
        " -  Instance Variable\n",
        "    -  Defined using self inside the constructor (__init__)\n",
        "    -  Each object has its own copy\n",
        "    -  Changing it affects only that object\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        " -  Multiple inheritance in Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) feature that allows a new class (child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent (base) class. This enables the child class to combine functionalities from multiple sources, promoting code reuse and the modeling of complex, real-world relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        " -  __str__ – User-friendly representation\n",
        "    -  Returns a readable, human-friendly string\n",
        "    -  Meant for end users\n",
        "    -  Used by print() and str()\n",
        " -   __repr__ – Developer-friendly representation\n",
        "     -  Returns an official, unambiguous representation\n",
        "     -  Mainly for developers and debugging\n",
        "     -  Used by repr() and in interactive shells\n",
        "     -  Ideally, it should recreate the object if possible\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        " -  The super() function in Python is used to call methods of a parent (superclass) from a child (subclass). It plays a crucial role in inheritance, especially when working with method overriding and multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " -   purpose of __del__?\n",
        "     -  The main purpose of __del__ is to perform cleanup actions before an object is removed from memory, such as:\n",
        "     -  Releasing external resources (files, network connections, database cursors)\n",
        "     -  Printing/logging cleanup messages (for debugging)\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        " -   @staticmethod\n",
        "     -  A static method is a method that:\n",
        "     -  Belongs to the class namespace\n",
        "     -  Does not receive self or cls\n",
        "  -   @classmethod\n",
        "      -  Receives the class itself (cls) as the first argument\n",
        "      -  Can access and modify class variables\n",
        "      -  Affects the class as a whole\n",
        "\n",
        "23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        " -  Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows objects of different subclasses to be treated as objects of a common parent class, while each subclass provides its own implementation of the same method.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        " -  Method chaining in Python OOP is a programming technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement. Each method returns the object itself (self), allowing the next method to be called immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " -  The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. When an object is followed by parentheses (), Python internally invokes its __call__ method."
